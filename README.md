>this project perform “Glot”a domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying Web Applications on the EMF platform by using one among the following tools notations:
- EMF
- Emfatic
- OCL In Ecore

## Task A4.1
>Define a metamodel in Emfatic or EMF for describing your domain(as illustrated during the course) 

Based on our previous projects developed on MPS, we defined 16 metaclasses. Each metaclass contains at least one attribute or reference as demonstrated in the screenshot below. Also, the metamodel was properly defined and contains inheritance, containment, enumeration types, attributes, data types, etc.

## Task A4.2
>Instantiate the metamodel by two concrete instance and make sure that each concept(represented as metaclasses) at the metamodel level can be instantiated in your models.

- Our metamodel was further instantiated by the first concrete instances named <b><i>“System.xmi”</i></b> with each concept represented in the above metaclasses, well instantiated in the model as seen in the image below;

- Additionally, the metamodel was further instantiated by the second concrete instances named <b><i>“System1.xmi”</i></b> with each concept also represented in the above metaclasses, well instantiated in the model too as seen in the image below;

## Task A4.3
>Define metamodel constraints(and“critiques”in the case of EVL),operation, and derived fields in OCL or EVL/EOL

We have defined the following constraints and critique for both models as demonstrated in the image below and available in the video recording attached also.
- To check if the Entity has special characters.
- To check if the Attributes have special characters.
- To check if the Entity name has more than 5 characters.
- To check if the Attributes name has more than 5 characters.
- Content cannot be more than 30 in a system.

We have also defined the following operations as seen in the image below and in the video recording. 
- Printing all entities of contents that are not empty.
- Printing all attributes of contents that are not empty.

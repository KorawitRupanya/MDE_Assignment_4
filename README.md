>this project perform “Glot”a domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying Web Applications on the EMF platform by using one among the following tools notations:
- EMF
- Emfatic
- OCL In Ecore

## Task A4.1
>Define a metamodel in Emfatic or EMF for describing your domain(as illustrated during the course) 

Based on our previous projects developed on MPS, we defined 18 metaclasses. With each metaclass containing at least one attribute or reference as demonstrated in the screenshot below. Also, the metamodel was properly defined and contains inheritance, containment, enumeration types, attributes, data types, etc.

## Task A4.2
>Instantiate the metamodel by two concrete instances and make sure that each concept(represented as metaclasses) at the metamodel level can be instantiated in your models.

- Our metamodel was further instantiated by the first concrete instances named <b><i>“System.xmi”</i></b> with each concept represented in the above metaclasses, well instantiated in the model as seen in the image below;

- Additionally, the metamodel was further instantiated by the second concrete instances named <b><i>“System1.xmi”</i></b> with each concept also represented in the above metaclasses, well instantiated in the model too as seen in the image below;

## Task A4.3
>Define metamodel constraints(and“critiques”in the case of EVL),operation, and derived fields in OCL or EVL/EOL
- 3 constraints (critique and constraints) to validate models
- 2 operations
- 2 derived fields (only for OCL)

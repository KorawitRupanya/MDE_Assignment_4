>this project perform “Glot”a domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying Web Applications on the EMF platform by using one among the following tools notations:
- EMF
- Emfatic
- OCL In Ecore

## Task A4.1
>Define a metamodel in Emfatic or EMF for describing your domain(as illustrated during the course) satisfying the following

- 12 metaclasses

## Task A4.2
>Instantiate the metamodel by two concrete instances and make sure that each concept(represented as metaclasses) at the metamodel level can be instantiated in your models.
## Task A4.3
>Define metamodel constraints(and“critiques”in the case of EVL),operation, and derived fields in OCL or EVL/EOL
- 3 constraints (critique and constraints) to validate models
- 2 operations
- 2 derived fields (only for OCL)
